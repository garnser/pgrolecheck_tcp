.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The

program listens on a specified port for incoming TCP connections, checks if the connected PostgreSQL database is in primary mode, and handles the connections based on the database's role. If the PostgreSQL server is in primary mode, it acknowledges the client connections; otherwise, it terminates them.

Specifies the password for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.

.TP
.B DBName

Specifies the destination for log output. Options include STDOUT for console output, a file path to log to a file, or 'syslog' to use the system's syslog service.

Blank lines and lines starting with a semicolon (;) are ignored. Each option must be on its own line and follow the format "OptionName=Value".

Example configuration:
